# KnightCodeCompiler_JRB
This project builds on what I learned in Assignment 3 in which I used the ASM
library to write bytecode directly to a class file and Assignment 4 in which I used a Hashmap.
The ANLTR library will provide the classes and mechanisms for me to build/walk a parse tree.
My goal is to extend those classes/mechanisms to write a bytecode class file based on
KnightCode that can be executed with Java.
